# _Find and Replace_
#### _C# Algorithm and Testing Practice_
#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in C#. It's a console app that takes in a long string from the user, then a word that is in the string, and finally a new word that may or may not already be in the initial long string. The console returns the long string with all occurences of the substring with the new substring. 
For example: `Input: I like the cat cathedral. cat , dog`
> Output: `I like the dog doghedral.`

## Setup/Installation Requirements

In the terminal, `cd ` to the directory folder.

Then `cd` to `FindAndReplace` folder.

Run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` to compile and be prompted shortly after.

Enjoy!
